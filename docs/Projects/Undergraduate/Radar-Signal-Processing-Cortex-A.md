## Description

This project challenges students to develop a high-performance, real-time radar signal processing system using ARM Cortex-A processor-based platforms, such as the Raspberry Pi. The core objective is to design and implement signal processing algorithms capable of detecting and tracking multiple moving targetsâ€”crucial functionality for applications like automotive ADAS, aerospace surveillance, and industrial robotics.

Students will begin by simulating radar signal processing techniques in MATLAB and Simulink, focusing on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), Doppler filtering, and Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection. Using Embedded Coder and DSP System Toolbox, these algorithms will be converted into optimized C code. Integration with the Ne10 library allows for further optimization by leveraging ARM NEON SIMD instructions, delivering real-time performance on edge platforms.

The final system will be deployed and validated on ARM Cortex-A hardware, benchmarking detection accuracy and latency to ensure robustness and real-time compliance. This hands-on project bridges the gap between signal processing theory and embedded system implementation, offering deep insights into algorithm optimization for Arm-based architectures.
