![research_on_arm](../images/Research_on_arm_banner.png)

### Project Difficulty
Challenging

**Audience:** Electronic Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to leverage the re-usable MCU platform 'Nanosoc' to host and support a custom research accelerator. The main deliverables include prototyping the accelerator in FPGA and then creating a physical silicon implementation using a pre-verified programmable control system. This project will provide practical experience in ASIC design, FPGA prototyping, and hardware acceleration. The final output will be a functional ASIC that integrates the custom accelerator, demonstrating the feasibility and performance of the design. **To undertake this project, please reach out to SoC Labs** in [this link](https://soclabs.org/).

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 9 months to 1 year to complete, involving a team of 4-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: Vivado, ModelSim, ASIC design tools
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), Nanosoc platform
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)
