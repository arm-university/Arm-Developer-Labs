## Description

This advanced project challenges students to design, implement, and verify a real-time automotive control application using MATLAB Simulink, Embedded Coder, and Arm Fast Models targeting the Cortex-M7 processor. Students will employ the V-Model software development lifecycle to enforce rigorous validation and verification at each stage, culminating in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup using Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL) simulation to measure code coverage and execution profiles. .

The focus is on the creation of a safety-critical control algorithm deployed to an Arm Cortex-M7 simulation environment, verified using processor-in-the-loop (PIL) with performance profiling. This project emulates an industrial-grade workflow and is ideal for students looking to venture into the automotive industry. 

Students can choose from of the following **automotive application topics**:
1. **[Automatic, In-Car Climate Control](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/simulating-automatic-climate-control-systems.html)**
2. **[Tyre Pressure Monitoring](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/wirelesss-tire-pressure-monitoring-system-with-fault-logging.html)**
3. **[Modeling an Anti-Lock Braking System](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/modeling-an-anti-lock-braking-system.html)**

Each project will go through system design, simulation in Simulink, code generation via Embedded Coder, and real-time testing using Arm Fast Models and Code Profile Analyzer. Deliverables include models, auto-generated code, verification reports, and benchmarking results.

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
