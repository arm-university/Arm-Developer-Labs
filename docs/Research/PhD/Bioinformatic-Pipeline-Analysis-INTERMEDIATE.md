### Project Difficulty

Challenging

### Description

This project aims to benchmark specific Bioconda packages that have been built for Arm64 using the nf-core-arm-discovery repository (GitHub link). The PhD candidate will utilize public genomic datasets from databases such as NCBI, select appropriate datasets, and execute bioinformatics workflows on Arm-based infrastructure. The candidate will evaluate the performance, compatibility, and efficiency of these packages, document errors and failures, and investigate the reasons behind package build failures. The final deliverable will be a detailed report with performance metrics, identified issues, and recommended improvements to enhance package support on Arm64.

### Deliverables:

Selection and justification of public genomic datasets.

Execution of bioinformatics workflows using Bioconda packages on Arm64.

Performance benchmarking and comparison with x86 architectures.

Documentation of failed package builds and proposed fixes.

Comprehensive report with results, analysis, and recommendations.

### Estimated Project Duration

Time:Â 1-6 months (depending on scope and complexity)

Participants: Individual PhD researcher (or small research team)

### Hardware / Software Requirements

Languages: Python, Bash, Nextflow

Tooling: nf-core pipelines, Conda, Docker/Singularity, Snakemake

Hardware: Access to Arm64-based cloud instances (e.g., AWS Graviton) with plenty of memory and storage

IP Access: Public genomic databases (NCBI, ENA, etc.), Bioconda repository
