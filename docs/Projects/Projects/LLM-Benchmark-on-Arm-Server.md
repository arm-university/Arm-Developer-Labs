title: LLM Benchmark for Arm Server
---

<img class="image image--xl" src="./images/Research_on_arm_banner.png"/>

## Description
This project aims to benchmark inference on Arm-based servers using the MLPerf Inference benchmark suite. The project spans performance analysis across different configurations of Arm-based servers. The main deliverable is a comprehensive benchmarking setup that can evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various Arm server configurations in addition to a report highlighting the performance difference and how to recreate the results. This project will provide practical experience in benchmarking, performance analysis, and working with Arm-based server architectures. The final output will be a detailed report and a functional benchmarking infrastructure that can be used for further research and development.
