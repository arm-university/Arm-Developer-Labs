title: Linux Capable SoC FPGA Prototyping Platform with DDR Memory
---

## Description
This project aims to leverage the Corstone-1000 platform to host and support a custom research accelerator. The main deliverables include prototyping the accelerator in FPGA and then creating a physical silicon implementation using a pre-verified programmable control system. The project will provide practical experience in SoC design, FPGA prototyping, and hardware acceleration. The final output will be a functional SoC FPGA prototyping platform with DDR memory, capable of running Linux and demonstrating the feasibility and performance of the design. **To undertake this project, please reach out to SoC Labs** in [this link](https://soclabs.org/).


## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: Vivado, ModelSim, ASIC design tools
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), Corstone-1000 platform
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)
