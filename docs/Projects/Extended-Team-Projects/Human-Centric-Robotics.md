title: Human-Centric Robotics â€“ Urban Deployment & Socioeconomic Modelling
---

Reach out to Arm at [education@arm.com](mailto:education@arm.com) if you'd like to participate in this challenge.

## Description

This project challenges students to design, build, and evaluate a human-centric robotic system for urban deployment using Arm-based compute platforms such as Raspberry Pi 5, NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, etc. The primary focus is on deploying prototypes in a controlled campus environment for applications like last-mile delivery, eldercare assistance, or smart waste collection.

Participants will integrate real-time navigation, object manipulation, and human-interaction modules using state-of-the-art computer vision and sensor fusion frameworks. The second phase involves simulating or evaluating the robotâ€™s impact on urban workflows and labor markets, including surveys or socioeconomic modeling techniques (e.g., system dynamics or agent-based simulation).

Potential Deliverables include:
- A working prototype running on an Arm-based platform
- Software stack (navigation, ML inference, interaction logic)
- Field evaluation results & UX data (e.g., survey or usage logs)
- Report of development process and considerations when prototyping an end-user product.
- A socioeconomic impact report using modeling or simulation techniques

*Note: Arm does not offer direct channels to municipalities or public testing environments. Projects should focus on campus deployments, simulated environments (e.g., Gazebo).*

## Estimated Project Duration

6+ months  
Team size: 2+ participants  
Can be extended for dissertation-level depth or research publication.
