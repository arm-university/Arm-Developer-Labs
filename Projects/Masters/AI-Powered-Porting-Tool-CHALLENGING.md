## Description

This project challenges students to build an intelligent automation tool for porting software packages â€” for use in domains such as [bioinformatic pipelines with Nextflow](https://github.com/arm-university/Arm-Projects-Labs/blob/main/PhD-Level/Bioinformatic-Pipeline-Analysis-INTERMEDIATE.md) or [statistics with R](https://github.com/arm-university/Arm-Projects-Labs/blob/main/PhD-Level/R-Arm-Community-Support-INTERMEDIATE.md).

Although most top Bioconda packages now support Linux/Arm, there's still a significant gap for native macOS on Apple Silicon, where many packages default to emulated x86 environments. Similarly, for the R community, Windows-on-Arm support for community created packages is lacking with many packages unable to build due to issues such as x86-specific code. 
Given the large number of community packages, applying manual patches is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, as many involve similar, repetitive adjustmentsâ€”highlighting the need for a scalable, automated solution.
The goal is to build a sophisticated system (beyond simple shell scripts) that uses dependency graph analysis, machine learning, to:

- Identify unported packages
- Trace recursive dependency issues
- Recommend or auto-generate build recipes and steps
- Evaluate build success and reattempt intelligently
- Generate pull requests when confident of a fix. 
- For complex packages, offer guidance to developers on how to port themâ€”for example, by suggesting tools like SSE2NEON for translating x86 SSE intrinsics.
- Be extensible to work with various  packaging systems and languages

ðŸ”¬ Students will gain practical experience with CI/CD systems, Python packaging with bioconda, 

This project is an ideal blend of automation, machine learning, and systems programming â€” built with real-world impact in mind. The outcome could directly contribute to open source ecosystems and help bring cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to wider hardware audiences.
