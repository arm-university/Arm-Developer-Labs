### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

**Audience** Electronic Engineering or Computer Engineering Students

## Description
This project aims to develop a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow for integrating hardware accelerators with Arm-based System on Chip (SoC). The main objective is to lower the barrier for computer science students to create hardware accelerators from software algorithms. The deliverables include a comprehensive HLS design flow, documentation detailing the steps involved, and a functional hardware accelerator integrated with an Arm-based SoC. This project will provide practical experience in HLS, SoC design, and hardware acceleration, making it an excellent learning opportunity for students interested in digital design and embedded systems.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 12-16 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-4 participants. There is no start date or hard deadline.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: C++, SystemVerilog (or other HDL), TCL, Python
- Tooling: Vivado HLS, ModelSim, HLS4ML. 
- Hardware: Access to FPGA development board with Arm CPU cores (e.g., [Xilinx Zynq 7000](https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/soc/zynq-7000.html) or [Intel Stratix-10 SX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/stratix/10/sx.html))
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)
