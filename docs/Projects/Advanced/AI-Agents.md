### Description 📌 

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered agent that automates repetitive and complex workflow tasks in a specific domain, such as software development, project management, or cloud operations. The AI agent will be deployed in a sandboxed environment to ensure safety, prevent unintended consequences, and provide controlled automation with strict oversight.

## Key Objectives 🔍 

Task Identification & Domain Selection: Choose a workflow domain (e.g., DevOps, educational content moderation, research assistance) that benefits from automation while avoiding sensitive applications like finance.

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather workflow logs, user interactions, and process documentation in a controlled manner to ensure safety and privacy.

Sandboxed Execution: Deploy the AI agent in a secure, isolated environment to test and validate automation before live system integration.

Integration with Existing Tools: Connect the AI agent with popular workflow tools like JIRA, Slack, Jenkins via APIs.

User Interface & Interaction: Develop a chatbot or dashboard to enable manual overrides, status tracking, and recommendation validation while enforcing safety checks.

Performance & Safety Evaluation: Measure automation effectiveness using KPIs such as time saved, accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to safety policies.

## Expected Outcomes 🎯  

✅ An AI-driven agent automating  repetitive tasks in a sandboxed environment.
✅ A performance & safety evaluation report showcasing efficiency improvements, cost reduction, and risk mitigation.
✅ A deployable prototype demonstrating real-world application and scalability.
