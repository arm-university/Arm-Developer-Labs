title: Develop an Arm Architecture Insight Dashboard
---

<img class="image image--xl" src="/Arm-Developer-Labs/images/can-i-use.jpg"/>


### Description

**Why this is important?** 

Developers often face challenges in selecting the appropriate platform for their software. With numerous smartphones and cloud instances available, gauging consumer popularity and availability can be difficult, and identifying software stack dependencies can be time-consuming. As Arm anticipates an increase in Arm-based products in the coming years, this situation is likely to become even more complex, requiring the need for a single, validated solution. 

**Project Summary**

This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard that lets a developer know what proportion of devices support a specific Arm CPU extension, similar to [“Can I use”](https://caniuse.com/) for web development and any software compatibility issues. The functional requirements for the Architecture Insights dashboard:

- Popularity of Arm architectures and Operating System combinations over time
- Searchable index of software, libraries and tools that have been optimised for a specific architecture. For example, "Does the video processing software, FFMPEG, support acceleration for SVE2 with Windows 11?"

 
Students will gain hands-on experience with data visualization, statistical analysis, web development, and market analysis, providing valuable insights into the Arm ecosystem. 

## Prequisites

You are free to explore your own implementation. The skills below are examples.

- Intemediate understanding of an OOP language such as Python or JavaScript
- Access to a computer with internet connectivity

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).


## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
