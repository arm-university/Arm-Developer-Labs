title: "DRAFT - Integrating Responsible AI into Dev Workflows via Yellow Teaming with PyTorch LLMs on Arm"

subjects:
    - ML
    - Security
    - CI-CD
    - Performance and Architecture

## Description

Responsible AI is increasingly a critical component of ethical software development. This project introduces "Yellow Teaming", a structured methodology for stress-testing AI products by exploring the full spectrum of consequences when systems succeed, not just fail. Students will build a PyTorch-based Yellow Teaming Assistant using a local LLM deployed on AWS or other Arm-based cloud providers.

The assistant will be integrated into a DevOps workflow of your choice (e.g., CI/CD pipeline or feature planning review system) to aid software teams in surfacing unintended second-order effects of new product features. Participants will implement this assistant using Llama3 or other available models, write their own curated system prompt and introduce yellow teaming into the software development lifecycle. For example, projects can produce product design documents, handle sprint retrospectives, or support Git-based code reviews.

## Hardware, Software and Skills Required

- **Hardware**:
  - Access to an Arm-based cloud instance, for example Arm-based Graviton4 processors.
- **Software**:
  - PyTorch and Hugging Face account
  - `torchchat` repo and dependencies
  - Hugging Face CLI for LLM download
  - Git, Python 3.10+, and various common build essentials (e.g., `make`, `g++`)
- **Skills**:
  - Proficiency in Python and PyTorch
  - [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/)
  - Understanding of LLMs and prompting techniques
  - Familiarity with DevOps tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
  - Basic knowledge of ethical AI and complex systems thinking
