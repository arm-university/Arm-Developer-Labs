![research_on_arm](../images/Research_on_arm_banner.png)

### Project Difficulty
Intermediate
**Audience:** Computer Science (CS) / Electrical Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to benchmark inference on Arm-based servers using the MLPerf Inference benchmark suite. The project spans performance analysis across different configurations of Arm-based servers. The main deliverable is a comprehensive benchmarking setup that can evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various Arm server configurations in addition to a report highlighting the performance difference and how to recreate the results. This project will provide practical experience in benchmarking, performance analysis, and working with Arm-based server architectures. The final output will be a detailed report and a functional benchmarking infrastructure that can be used for further research and development.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 8-12 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, C++
- Tooling: MLPerf, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Hardware: Arm-based server, access to cloud service providers
