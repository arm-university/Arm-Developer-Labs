## Audience
Electronic Engineering

## Description
This project aims to develop a reference design of AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) infrastructure. You are free to choose which AMBA protocol and version of the interconnect standard to implement with more simple specifications e.g., APB, being easier to create than coherent protocols such as AMBA CHI. 

The main deliverables include the Verilog design of the AMBA infrastructure, a Verilog test bench for testing the design, an RTL (Register Transfer Level) simulation flow to verify the functionality, and an FPGA prototyping platform to demonstrate the design in a real-world environment. The project will provide a comprehensive understanding of AMBA protocols and their implementation, making it an excellent learning opportunity for students interested in digital design and hardware description languages.

## Prequisites

- Intermediate understanding of Verilog, SystemVerilog or other hardware description languages (HDL).
- Access and basic understanding of ModelSim, Quartus and Vivado
- Access to a suitable FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), simulation tools

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution.
