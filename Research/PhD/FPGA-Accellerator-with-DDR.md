### Project Difficulty
Challenging
**Audience:** Electronic Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to leverage the Corstone-1000 platform to host and support a custom research accelerator. The main deliverables include prototyping the accelerator in FPGA and then creating a physical silicon implementation using a pre-verified programmable control system. The project will provide practical experience in SoC design, FPGA prototyping, and hardware acceleration. The final output will be a functional SoC FPGA prototyping platform with DDR memory, capable of running Linux and demonstrating the feasibility and performance of the design. **To undertake this project, please reach out to SoC Labs** in [this link](https://soclabs.org/).

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6 months to 1 year to complete, involving a team of 4-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.
