Welcome to our **Research Themes** page, where academic innovation meets real-world impact. This space highlights research areas that are not only industrially relevant to **Arm** and the broader **software ecosystem**, but also critical to shaping the **future of technology and employability** in this space.

As part of a **pilot initiative**, we're actively exploring collaborative opportunities with academia to better align cutting-edge research with industry needs. Whether you're working on low-power computing, compilers, system architecture, machine learning, trusted execution, or developer tools, we want to hear from you.

## Why This Matters

The future of computing is shaped by research today. At Arm, we're committed to supporting research that addresses real challenges in software design, system optimization, and future-looking platforms. Aligning research efforts with industrial needs can help students and researchers:

- Understand practical, scalable applications of their work  
- Gain visibility and build connections in the tech industry  
- Improve their employability by working on technologies that are in high demand  
- Get early access to collaboration opportunities and internal referrals  

## Research Areas of High Interest to Arm

Coming soon

Example research projects that both industrially relevant to the Arm ecosystem and exciting for academia are available on the left-hand side navigation bar. 

## Collaborate with Arm

We’re inviting **short-term project proposals** from academic researchers and students where Arm can potentially offer technical insight, mentorship, or in-kind contributions to support your research. These projects could serve as proof-of-concepts or initial steps toward longer-term collaboration.

If you're working on something innovative and believe there's a fit with Arm’s ecosystem, let us know!

## Tell Us About Your Research

Are you a **student** or **researcher** working on a topic related to Arm’s software ecosystem? We'd love to hear more about your work and its potential impact. Please reach out to us at [university@arm.com](mailto:university@arm.com) and tell us:

- What you're researching  
- How it connects to Arm’s technologies or future needs  
- Any ideas for collaboration or joint exploration  

This is a **pilot project**, so we’re eager to shape this initiative based on your input and participation. Let's build the future—together.
