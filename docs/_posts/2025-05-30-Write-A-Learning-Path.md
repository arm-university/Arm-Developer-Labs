title: Write an Educational Tutorial (Learning Path) of your Choice
---

<img class="image image--xl" src="/Arm-Developer-Labs/images/Educate_on_Arm_banner.png"/>


## Description
This exciting opportunity invites master students to create and submit a comprehensive learning path focused on any aspect of Arm technology. Participants will have the chance to showcase their expertise, contribute to the academic community, and potentially publish their work for a wider audience. Learning paths are structured tutorials that guide learners through a series of topics and skills. For example, a project could involve developing a learning path on Arm-based embedded systems, culminating in a practical demonstration of a working prototype, such as a simple temperature monitoring system using a basic microcontroller and a few sensors. This project can be easily recreated with minimal hardware and software access. We look forward to seeing your innovative and insightful submissions!

## Prequisites

- Computer with Internet Connectivity

## Resources from Arm and our partners

- Documentation: [How to create a learning path](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/cross-platform/_example-learning-path/)
- Documentation: (https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/arm-learning-paths/discussions/categories/ideas-for-new-learning-paths)

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
