## Description

This advanced project challenges students to design, implement, and verify a real-time automotive control application using MATLAB Simulink, Embedded Coder, and Arm Fast Models targeting the Cortex-M7 processor. Students will employ the V-Model software development lifecycle to enforce rigorous validation and verification at each stage, culminating in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup using Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL) simulation to measure code coverage and execution profiles. .

The focus is on the creation of a safety-critical control algorithm deployed to an Arm Cortex-M7 simulation environment, verified using processor-in-the-loop (PIL) with performance profiling. This project emulates an industrial-grade workflow and is ideal for students looking to venture into the automotive industry. 

Students can choose from of the following **automotive application topics**:
1. **[Automatic, In-Car Climate Control](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/simulating-automatic-climate-control-systems.html)**
2. **[Tyre Pressure Monitoring](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/wirelesss-tire-pressure-monitoring-system-with-fault-logging.html)**
3. **[Modeling an Anti-Lock Braking System](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/modeling-an-anti-lock-braking-system.html)**

Each project will go through system design, simulation in Simulink, code generation via Embedded Coder, and real-time testing using Arm Fast Models and Code Profile Analyzer. Deliverables include models, auto-generated code, verification reports, and benchmarking results.
