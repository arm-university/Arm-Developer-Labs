## Description  

**Why this is important?**

As of June 2025, [94% of global automakers](https://newsroom.arm.com/blog/arm-zena-css-ai-defined-vehicle-compute-platform) use Arm vehicle technology. The development of compliance-ready smart camera systems is crucial for Arm as it aligns with the increasing demand for safety and reliability in automotive platforms, see the [Arm Zena compute subsystem(CSS)](https://www.arm.com/products/automotive/compute-subsystems/zena) for more details. 

**Project summary**

Government and external regulations, particularly in automotive industries, are shaping how smart camera products are designed, implemented, and verified. This project will explore how compliance with standards like ISO 26262 influences the design of smart camera systems, such as Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) to ensure driver attentiveness. Students or engineers will collaborate with industry-relevant platforms, such as Arm's Kronos Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) for automotive development, to understand and propose frictionless developer experiences aligned with functional safety standards.

Deliverables include:
- Developing a full end-to-end smart camera system that can be incorporated into a functional safety environment (such as automotive or medical), following the relevant standards for development (e.g., ISO 26262)
- A survey of regulatory requirements and their impact on smart camera design
- An architectural analysis integrating Arm-based systems into a compliant automotive software stack
- Recommendations for enhancing developer tools and reference software stacks to align with ISO standards

## Estimated Project Duration  
- Estimated Time: 6+ months  
- Participants: Team of 2+

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.
