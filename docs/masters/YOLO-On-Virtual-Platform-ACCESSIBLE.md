### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

## Description
This project aims to create a comprehensive learning path for fellow academics and developers on how to run Yolo v8 by installing and configuring an Arm Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) and other relevant packages. The main deliverable is a detailed document that guides users through the entire process, from setting up the FVP to running a demo of Yolo v8. This project will provide practical experience in working with Arm FVPs and running machine learning models on them. The final output will be a well-documented learning path that can be used as a reference by others.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 1 week to complete, involving a small team of 1-2 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python
- Tooling: Arm Fixed Virtual Platform, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Hardware: Access to a computer with internet connectivity
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)
