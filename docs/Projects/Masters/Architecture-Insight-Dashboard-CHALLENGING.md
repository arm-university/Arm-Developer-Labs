### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

**Audience:** Computer Science (CS) and STEM students. 

### Description
Developers struggle to decide which platform to target their software. There are many smartphones and cloud instances to choose from but the consumer popularity is difficult to gauge and software stack dependencies issues are time-consuming to identify.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard that lets a developer know what proportion of devices support a specific Arm CPU extension, similar to [“Can I use”](https://caniuse.com/) for web development and any software compatibility issues. The functional requirements for the Architecture Insights dashboard:

- Popularity of Arm architectures and Operating System combinations over time
- Searchable index of software, libraries and tools that have been optimised for a specific architecture. For example, "Does the video processing software, FFMPEG, support acceleration for SVE2 with Windows 11?"

 
Students will gain hands-on experience with data visualization, statistical analysis, web development, and market analysis, providing valuable insights into the Arm ecosystem. 

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 8-12 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-4 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Skills

You are free to explore your own implementation. The skills below are examples.

- Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Tooling: D3.js, Flask/Django for the dashboard, APIs for data collection
- Hardware: Access to a computer with internet connectivity
